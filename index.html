  <mark>Information</mark> throughout human era has been a very important aspect of success, especially in health and medicine. Technology specifially computers are getting more advanced an accessible throughout the world, and is being used for many things such as health informatics. The extracting, managing, utilization of information in health and medicines can significantly improve the much needed quality of medical care and response to public emergencies. They are also ranging from local to global, from individual patiens to sharing data about disease outbreaks for governments and international health organizations. Many things have been done with systems engineering to make information about patients and maintaing them sufficient, but there is much to do to make it optimal in usage.</p>

        <p><mark>Mixtures of old traditional ways to keep track of information are plagued with new ways such as with the computers.</mark>Often records on the computer are incompatible, because they use different programs with different data and variables even with the same range of hospitals. Sharing information as range increased get more difficult and complicated because there is even a bigger difference in computers and data depending on the place it was sent from and to. To improve on this even a little bit, future technolgoies must be engineered for seamless sharing of data, with convenient and efficient ways of managing medical records/information. Some people can also take advantage of other people too. Another way to improve things is to develop trusted systems that offer relevant decisions that support clinicians and patients as well as archived medical research information. The workers in the med field can suffer from overloading information without well functioning electronic devices for finding informations for their patients.

<p><mark>New technologies will be made that will benefit all parties greatly.</mark> Some new technologies can have medical data being observed and recorded, examples being heart rate and temperature. The monitoring devices can be in many forms not just in smart watches like in chips in clothing, or some art of the body, etc. Tiney sensors containing wireless transmitter-receivers could possibly provide the monitoring of patiens in any place. If made common, with the abundance of information, they can be intrapolated to predict things and can alert health professionals when a patient needs attention, or if advanced enough have a device that triggers the release of drugs into the body when needed.

        <p><br>On a local to global scale, <mark>robust health informatic systems could potentially benefit health professionals to detect, track, and prevent both natural health and terrorism emergencies.</mark> Biological and chemical warfare can happen anywhere still even in this era, that's why it's important to come up with a solution to these problems. Terrorist have a vast variety of biological and chemical weapons examples being anthrax, ricin, and botulism neurotoxin. Anthrax has been getting a lot of special attention because of the amount of deaths it caused lately.</br></p>

            </div>
        </section>
        <p><mark>Providing data to give to a informatics system in preparation of terrorists biochemical and chemical attacks involve three main things:</mark> <u>Surveillance and detection</u>-- monitoring the early signs of attacks are important such the chang ein air, water, soil, and food; <u>Rapid diagnosis</u>-- needing a system that can analyze and identify the originator of harm as well as track its current real time location and it's effects like spread; <u>Countermeasures</u>-- nimble operations that can develop and mass-produce antidotes, vaccines, or other treatments to counter the effects of the terrorist attacks. This is a major challenge and still in it's early phase. Examples of things that can detect differences is the "artifical noses", kind of like the canine noses but not better. Other toxins and viruses can also be found by using biological detectors, such as ultra-tiny biological "nanopore" devices that send electrical signals when a dangerous molecule is passed through the pore. Just data that can track and identify these information really make it possible to idenitfy biowarfare agents quicky with simple things like blood tests.</p>

                <h1>How to prepare against a pandemic?</h1>
            </div>
        </section>
        <p><mark>Natural biology or natural things that happen like diseases, pandemics, etc can be real devastating.</mark> Take for example like the <u>Black death or the Spanish flu</u> that kill millions of people.  The power of the diseases are no joke. A major goal to be prepared for pandemics is a early warning system, that relys on the global/national surveillance to detect the onset of spreading infectious diseases. There are some system like mentioned in place today. Some catches the problems and gives warning while some events mask the trends in these statistics making it harder to find the problems, which requires more advanced monitoring devices/strategies. Having an integrated national information technology infrastructure would benefit everyone significantly. Information like that will allow people to go to hospitals to get treated early or scare them and make them not want to go to the hospital due to fear of being infected. Math helps describe relationships that help with health care use. It can help in devising a method to help with the current situation. There are many methods of countering pandemics could be reducing physical contact with humans and interactions by restricting travel and closing schools. Response systems must take into consideration of how people will act. Rapid development of vaccines or treatment is now a must in this era. A system or systems will be required to sample things such as virus rapidly to get the data and quickly develop medications and vaccines. But the systems need the right technology to be able to do rapid testing. If there is a emergency viral outbreak in days or weks, it would be useless and completely hopeless wwith regulatory approval if taken years. These systems of information may be great but new problems can arise like the misuse or comprise of information. </p>
